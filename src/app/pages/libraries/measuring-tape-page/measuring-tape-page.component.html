    <p>Measuring Tape Library</p>

    <p>
        The measuring tape library is a much simpler library as it&#39;s intended use is for fine tuning the sizes of the other libraries which will be covered more later in the documentation.  The syntax for using this library is --mt-[size] and the size can be anything between 1 - 44.  Unlike the box sizes there are no static pixel sizes with the measuring tape library meaning it&#39;s 100% proportional to the user&#39;s screen.  The smallest setting --mt-1 is 1/11th of 1/33rd of the screen&#39;s width and --mt-2 is just --mt-1 * 2 while --mt-3 is --mt-1 * 3 and so on and so on which is why we decided to call it a measuring tape.  Below is a demo that shows how each size scales.

        That&#39;s pretty much all there is to say about this library for now so lets learn about the Text Size Library.
